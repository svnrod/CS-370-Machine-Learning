# CS-370-Machine-Learning

In this project, we were tasked with challenge of developing an intelligent agent that would play a "pirate" on a treasure hunt. This intelligent agent was trained through Reinforcement Learning and Q-learning to find the most optimal path to the treasure on a 8x8 2D grid. In this grid there are obstacles and challenges along the way that the agent must learn to traverse through. Using deep Q-learning, the agent is able to explore it's environment by trying out different actions and then utlitize exploitation to decipher the most optimal path to winning the treasure hunt. We were given the starter code base via Jupyter notebook along with a few lines of pseudocode to guide us through developing the Q-training algorithm for this intelligent agent.

- What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

  Computer scientists are the brains and soul behind innovations in software, computing, hardware, and more. I like to think of Computer Scientists as problem solvers. They are usually the best at solving techincal problems by applying math, science, logical reasoning, and programming to their work. Computer Science and Scientists as a whole is a wide spectrum of different technologies and industries. For example, Computer Scientists may be the ones who develop deep learning algorithms but they may also work on similar yet differing areas of focus such as cryptography, security, software, machine learning, data science, and more. Computer Scientists and their work matters because all we see around us and the rapid innovation we still see happening in our daily lives can be attributed to the original and continous work of Computer Scientists and developers around the world. Computer Scientists help make our daily lives better by tackling the world's most complex problems.

- How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

  Approaching a problem as a Computer Scientist involves questioning, logical reasoning, and testing. A Computer Scientist may first start off by breaking down problems into smaller tasks or questions. From there, they might develop an approach to tackling the entire problem. Through designing and implementing different methods of solving the problem, Computer Scientists then test their work and iteratively approach a potential solution to their problem.

- What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

  Every Computer Scientist and Engineer must work ethically to ensure their technology is safe for their end users and protects their rights as a human. Working ethically for a Computer Scientist includes ensuring user's data and privacy is protected as well as holding transparency about how their data is being used or stored. This is important for the end user most importantly but also instills trust amongst developers, and corporations, and the general public.
